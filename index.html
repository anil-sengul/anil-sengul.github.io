  <h1>Hi there, I'm Anil!</h1>
  <p class="home-p">
    I am a member of the PowerCoders community as a student since 6 July 2020.
    Since now, I have already learned many important details about social skills
    to prepare myself for the interviews.
  </p>
  <p class="home-p">
    Between 10 August and 7 September, I will share with you the information I
    learned daily through this blog. You can track my progress via this blog day
    by day.
  </p>
  <p class="home-p">
    I would like to express my sincere thanks to all Swiss people who provided
    us this opportunity and to the PowerCoders team who gave this project to
    life.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="home-p">
    Sincerely,
    <br />
    T. Anil Sengül
