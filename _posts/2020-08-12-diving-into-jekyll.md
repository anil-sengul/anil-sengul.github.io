Today, I have continued reading about Github Pages, markdown language, and its structure. Then, I downloaded the Blog project to my PC to make local changes. But the project did not start in the first run. Then, I searched solutions about how can I run may Github-Pages locally on my PC. At the end of the day, I solved the problem. Then, I read about Jekyll to use Github-Pages more effectively. I realized that GitHub pages does not support every plugin of Jekyll and versions. I investigate that which versions and plugins does Github-pages use? For example, It does not support the last version of pagination for blogs. Then, I searched about how could I use pagination if my blog had too many posts. I figure it out the end of the day.
