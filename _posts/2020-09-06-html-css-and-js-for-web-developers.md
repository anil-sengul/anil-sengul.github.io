I tried hard to complete the last submission of the course. But I could not fully complete it. I submitted my code even it is not fully completed. Then, I have started to review classmate's codes. And finally, I realized my mistake in one line code and I fixed it. At the end of the day, I completed the all course. [Here](https://anil-sengul.github.io/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/module5-solution/assignment5-solution-starter/) is the link to my last submission.
