Today, I have worked on to make my own design for my blog. That's why I needed to search for Flex-box. After my readings, I have started my design. At the end of the day, It was ready with a couple of mistakes. I am still working on them to fix. Adding images is also tricky. I should work on images and aligning items to make it fancier.
