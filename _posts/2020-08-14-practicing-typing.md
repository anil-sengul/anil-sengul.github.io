Today and during this week especially in the evenings, I have completed related chapters in the "Practice typing" task which were Intermediate, Advanced, Tech Readiness, Career Prep. and Coding Essentials. I typed and read a total of 7 hours. My average typing speed is 34 wpm and my accuracy rate is 96%. I will try to speed up my typing speed in the "Coding Essentials" part more until the 7 September.
