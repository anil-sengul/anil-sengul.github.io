Today, I have continued to watch HTML Essential Training videos from Linked In Learning website. I have completed 80% of it. After I complete all sections of the course, the first thing I will update my blog's Html structure the way how the course explained for each tag.

As a summary, I have reviewed what is semantic of the most important tags. I have also repeated which tag is inline and which tag is a block-level element. I have discovered that there is also an exception for "img" tag about being inline or block-level element.
