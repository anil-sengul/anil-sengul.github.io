Today is the first day of the preparation days. First of all, I have watched the videos in the ClassRoom and read the presentation carefully. Then, I have downloaded Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. Then, I have downloaded the Visual Studio Code and the recommended extensions which are Live Server, Prettier, and vs code-faker.
