Finally, I completed all videos of the module-2 in the Coursera Course. You can find and look at my submission through this [link](https://anil-sengul.github.io/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/module-2-solution/). Tomorrow, I will start to watch the third week of the videos and I will apply my learnings from the second week to my blog site.
