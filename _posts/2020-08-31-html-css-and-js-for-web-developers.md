Then, I watched videos of Javascript in module-4 which I am already familiar with. At the end of the day, I completed the submission of module-4. You can find the link [here](https://anil-sengul.github.io/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/module4-solution/easier/). Tomorrow, I am planing to start module-5 videos.
